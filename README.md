# Pangrazzi Book Cafe Website

## About the Project
This project is a static website for a fictional book cafe, "Pangrazzi Book Cafe". It demonstrates my skills in HTML and CSS, including:

- Proper semantic structure with `<header>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` elements.
- CSS styling for layout, colors, and spacing.
- Responsive design principles using percentages and max-width containers.
- Clear and maintainable code organization.

You can access the HTML and CSS code in the files above:
- `PangrazziBookCafe.html` — contains the HTML structure and content of the Pangrazzi Book Cafe website.
- `PortfolioStyles.css` — contains all CSS styling rules for layout, colors, and spacing.

## Skills Practiced
- HTML structure and semantics
- CSS selectors, floats, margins, padding, and background colors
- Layout techniques: float, clear, and container-based design
- Cross-browser styling considerations
- Attention to detail for readability and user experience

## Project Preview
The layout includes:

- A centered container with a header, main article, and sidebar.
- Upcoming events listed in the main content area.
- Sidebar highlighting services.
- Footer with contact info, styled consistently with the header.
